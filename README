The GFS contains the following subdirectories

1. sorc - source code
2. verify - verification of results
3. nnp - libraries
4. data - all data including initial conditions needed to run the forecast model
5. run.t574.slg - run scripts and standard out files

  Building the libraries
    
    The script called build.sh builds the ncep and 3rd party library esmf
    for the intel compiler.  The script is executed with 'build.sh
    intel' Users need to check and modify if necessary the compile
    variables in nnp/lib_3rdparty/install_3rdparty.sh and in
    nnp/lib_ncep/install_nceplibs.sh before executing build.sh.  The
    compiled libraries will appear in nnp/lib.  

    For example on the current WCOSS IBM system:
    cd nnp 
    module load ics/17.0.3
    build.sh intel

    and on the current WCOSS Cray system:
    cd nnp
    module load PrgEnv-intel/5.2.82 
    module rm intel
    module load intel/18.1.163 cray-mpich
    build.sh intel.cray
 
    and on current WCOSS Dell system:
    cd nnp
    module load ips/18.0.1.163 impi/18.0.1
    build.sh intel

  Building the GFS (using same compiler level as the library build)
  cd sorc 
  makefile.sh.bench <ibm,cray,dell> this
  takes one argument which identifies the build system for the WCOSS
  ibm , cray, or dell systems.

When it finishes successfully the executable global_fcst will appear
in sorc directory.  The makefile.sh.bench uses the intel compiler.

  Running GFS T574

The run scripts are in gfs/run.t574.slg.  You will need to set
RUNFCSTDIR to your run directory.  A sample script for WCOSS IBM 
is x.bench.ibm, x.bench.cray for WCOSS Cray, and x.bench.dell for WCOSS dell system.
The length of the forecast run is set by FHMAX in the file gfs_namelist located in
the data subdirectory; it is set to 240 hours.  
Standard out files are out.ibm, out.cray, and out.dell.

Verification
See README in the verify subdirectory
